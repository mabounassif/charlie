# Chess Opening Recommendation System - Project Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a personalized chess opening recommendation system that analyzes your games, identifies weaknesses, and suggests specific openings and variations to study. The system combines Maia-2 models, Stockfish evaluation, and machine learning to provide data-driven study recommendations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with these core components:

### 1. **PGN Parser** (`src/core/pgn_parser.py`)
- Parses chess games from PGN format
- Extracts moves, positions, and game metadata
- Converts games to structured data for analysis

### 2. **Stockfish Evaluator** (`src/evaluation/stockfish_evaluator.py`)
- Integrates with Stockfish chess engine
- Evaluates positions and moves
- Provides centipawn scores for mistake classification

### 3. **Mistake Classifier** (`src/classification/mistake_classifier.py`)
- Classifies moves as blunders, mistakes, inaccuracies, or good moves
- Uses configurable thresholds based on evaluation changes
- Calculates mistake statistics per opening

### 4. **Opening Classifier** (`src/classification/opening_classifier.py`)
- Identifies chess openings from move sequences
- Uses ECO codes and opening databases
- Groups games by opening for analysis

### 5. **Recommendation Engine** (`src/recommendation/recommendation_engine.py`)
- Generates personalized study recommendations
- Calculates priority scores based on mistake patterns
- Creates comprehensive study plans

## üìä Analysis Pipeline

```
PNG Files ‚Üí Parser ‚Üí Stockfish Evaluation ‚Üí Mistake Classification ‚Üí Opening Classification ‚Üí Recommendations
```

1. **Parse PGN files** containing your chess games
2. **Evaluate positions** using Stockfish engine
3. **Classify mistakes** based on evaluation changes
4. **Identify openings** for each game
5. **Generate recommendations** for study priorities

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd chess-recommender

# Run the installation script
./install.sh

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run analysis on your PGN file
python src/main.py --pgn-file data/games/your_games.pgn

# Or use the sample games for testing
python src/main.py --pgn-file data/games/sample_games.pgn
```

### Configuration
Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Stockfish engine path
- Evaluation depth and time limits
- Mistake classification thresholds
- Recommendation parameters

## üìà Output

The system generates:

1. **Detailed Analysis** (`analysis_results.json`)
   - Game statistics
   - Mistake analysis per opening
   - Opening performance metrics

2. **Study Recommendations** (`recommendations.txt`)
   - Prioritized opening list
   - Study focus areas
   - Estimated study time

3. **Study Plan** (included in JSON output)
   - Ranked openings to study
   - Focus areas (tactical, positional, etc.)
   - Time estimates for each opening

## üéØ Key Features

### Personalized Analysis
- Analyzes your specific games and playing style
- Identifies your weakest openings
- Suggests study priorities based on your mistakes

### Data-Driven Recommendations
- Uses Stockfish evaluation for objective analysis
- Considers mistake frequency and severity
- Provides confidence levels for recommendations

### Comprehensive Study Plans
- Suggests specific openings to study
- Identifies focus areas (tactics, strategy, etc.)
- Estimates study time requirements

## üîß Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **python-chess**: Chess game parsing and move generation
- **Stockfish**: Position evaluation engine
- **PyTorch**: Machine learning framework (for future Maia integration)
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data processing and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization (future feature)

### Configuration
The system is highly configurable through `config.yaml`:
- Engine settings (depth, time limits)
- Mistake thresholds (blunder, mistake, inaccuracy)
- Analysis parameters (max games, min moves)
- Recommendation settings (top openings, confidence)

## üöß Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Opponent Modeling
- Train Maia models on opponent games
- Simulate games between your model and opponent models
- Analyze opening effectiveness against specific opponents

### Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning
- Implement RL framework for opening selection
- Optimize study recommendations through simulation
- Continuous improvement based on results

### Phase 4: Extended Analysis
- Midgame motif detection
- Endgame classification and study
- Comprehensive study plans including tactics and strategy

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Stockfish not found**
   - Install Stockfish: `sudo apt-get install stockfish`
   - Update path in `config.yaml`

2. **Missing dependencies**
   - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Memory issues with large PGN files**
   - Reduce `max_games` in config
   - Process files in smaller batches

### Getting Help

- Check the logs in `chess_analysis.log`
- Run with `--log-level DEBUG` for detailed output
- Review the example notebook for usage patterns
